# Holistic Wind Farm Control
Investigation of the impact of holistic control of turbines in a wind farm

## Files
- [exploration.ipynb](exploration.ipynb) - Exploration of the impact of parameters such as yaw, wind speed and wind direction on cost and utilisation
- [optimisation.ipynb](optimisation.ipynb) - Optimisation of yaw values for different wind and site conditions to reduce cost

## To investigate
- Curtailment of front turbines as well as steering
- Variable hub height (more for floating turbines)
- Off design performance
- Real time steering values
    - CNN
    - Lookup table/surrogate model
    - Low fidelity model
    - LiDAR adjustments
