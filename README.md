# Holistic Wind Farm Control
Investigation of the impact of holistic control of turbines in a wind farm

## To investigate
- Impact of wake steering on yield and turbulence energy (impacts O&M costs and uptime)
- Curtailment of front turbines as well as steering
- Sensitivity to direction/wind speed
- Variation in sensitivity between turbines
- Sensitivity across sites/turbine types
- Variable hub height (more for floating turbines)
- Real time steering values
    - CNN
    - Lookup table/surrogate model
    - Low fidelity model
    - LiDAR adjustments

## Considerations
- Off design performance
- OCC and O&M
- Uptime
- Turbulence impact on O&M and uptime

## To do
Increase speed
- Identify problematic model type
- Identify problematic model values
- Time for flowmap vs aep
