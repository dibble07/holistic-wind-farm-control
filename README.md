# Holistic Wind Farm Control
Investigation of the impact of holistic control of turbines in a wind farm

## To consider
- Impact of wake steering on yield and turbulence energy (impacts O&M costs and uptime)
- Curtailment of front turbines as well as steering
- Sensitivity to direction/wind speed
- Variation in sensitivity between turbines
- Sensitivity across sites/turbine types
- Variable hub height (more for floating turbines)
- Off design performance
